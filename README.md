#Install
The build the engine you must have cmake installed as there are no project solutions available (i.e. cmake will generate these on the given platform)

##Command line install
- cd Path/of/vici/root
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..

This will generate the project files needed to execute the engine. Note that the engine is in a very much prime state at the moment so only windows is available and a lot of clean-up is needed.

#Description
This is a side project I am working on just out of interest and for learning new things in game engine architecture. I don't plan on selling this so feel free to download and have a poke around, just remember I have recently started this so a lot of clean-up is required!
