#Documentation
The documentation for this project is auto-generated by using Doxygen. To keep the repository size as small as it can be, the doc files have been added to the gitignore file and will (at some point) be hosted somewhere. 
However, if you have doxygen installed generate it by entering the command

doxygen Doxyfile
