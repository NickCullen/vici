#Documentation
The documentation for this project is auto-generated using Doxygen. To keep the repository size as small as it can be, the doc files have been added to the gitignore file.
However, if you have doxygen installed you can generate it by entering the the following command In the root directory (directory above this one):

doxygen Doxyfile

To view the output open the following file in a web browser:

doc/html/index.html


###Hosted Documentation
You can find the hosted version of the doc [here](http://nickcullen.net/Files/vicidoc/classes.html) although this won't be updated frequently and is just there for example.
